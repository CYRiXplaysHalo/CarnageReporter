# CarnageReporterMCCPC

This is currently a simply python script that will save off your Halo 1 MCC PC carange report files into a non-temporary directory to preserve them since the game simply overwrites this file in its temporary directory after a new game is completed. It simply just looks to see if the files' modified date changed every minute and if it does, save it off.
